# Introducing the Astro Starter Theme
The Astro Starter Theme is a basic template  that has all of the Astro setup and configuration for you, so that you can jump right into development.
---
Key features of this theme include 
- Basic CSS styling
- Common layouts built with props
- Header and Footer templates 
- A pre-built navigation with stock pages added

## Step  #1 - Create a template out of the repo
First of all click "Create template on this github page. Then go ahead and set up your own repository based upon this one.

## Step #2 - Get it onto your machine 
After you created your github repository, now it's time to get it onto your computer to work with. There's a few ways to do it 
1. Download the zip file 
2. Clone using [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
3. Setup with [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

Once you do, open it in your text editor of choice.

## Step #3 - Install dependencies 
Once you have the theme on your system, now it's time to install the dependencies that are required for the theme to work properly. To do so, open up a terminal and type the following command 

```sh
npm install
```
**You will need to have [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your system in order to run this command**
## Step #4 Run the theme
Once you have the theme dependencies installed, it is now time to run it in a local development environment. To do so, run the following command 

```sh
npm start 
```
**You will need to have [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en) & the theme dependencies installed on your system in order to run this command**

This will launch the theme in the browser on localhost:4321 In your browser. It will automatically refresh every time you make a change in your project 

## Step #5 Build your website!
You are now ready to begin developing your website! Feel free to add more pages, components, and layouts to make it your own.

I've tried to keep the styling very bare bones so you can easily implement your own styling choices. Feel free to strip it out and add your styling. **NOTE: you may want to keep the reset stylesheet as it is a hard reset of the browser defaults**
